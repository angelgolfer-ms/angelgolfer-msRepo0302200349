The OneNote service root URL uses the following format for all calls to the OneNote API.
`https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/me/onenote/`

The `version` segment in the URL represents the version of Microsoft Graph that you want to use.
- `v1.0` is for stable production code.
- `beta` is to try out a feature that's in development. Features and functionality in beta may change, so you shouldn't use it in your production code.
- `me` is for OneNote content that the current user can access (owned and shared).
- `users/{id}` is for OneNote content that the specified user (in the URL) has shared with the current user. Use the [Azure AD Graph API]


> [!NOTE]
> You can get user ids by making a GET request on `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users`.
